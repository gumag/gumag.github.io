Rahma Warsame is an American Muslim woman of Somali origin. Last Sunday, June 4th in Columbus, Ohio she saw a white man harassing another Muslim woman and tried to intervene to protect her. The man who was heard screaming "you all will be shipped back to Africa"  became violent and brutally beat her on the face until she lost consciousness. She suffered bruises, facial fractures and lost four teeth.

Rahma was taken to Riverside Hospital which also happens to be her place of work. The attacker was interviewed by police, but witnesses said he was released without charge.

Activist Linda Sarsour has stepped in to help the victim through a <a href="https://www.launchgood.com/project/stand_with_sister_rahma#/">launchgood fundraising</a> and working with Ohio's chapter of CAIR to bring the attacjer to justice. She wrote on facebook "We are working with locals and CAIR OH on getting Rahma justice but in the meantime please give what you can. Letâ€™s show our sister that we got her back and she has nothing to worry about. The perpetrator is not forgotten. He will be brought to justice."
