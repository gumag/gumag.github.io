It has been a little over 4 years since Marcela Daza chose Islam as her religion.

Although she only left her office for a moment to buy a coffee, she never goes unnoticed on the street. Walk along Suba Avenue with 100 Street and most passers-by look at it; some comment among themselves.
Marcela Daza lives in the Colombian city of Barranquilla, she is a mother, wife, worker and four years Muslim. She wears her hijab, the veil that covers her head, with pride and style: she binds it in a creative way that makes her seem, as she says, 'very fashionista'.

But its purpose goes further. In days when the Islamic State group makes the main news headlines in the world, she wants to change the image of her religion before society. Especially, in Colombia. "Muslims are justifying themselves by facts that have nothing to do with Islam. Suicide, for example, is not allowed. We have nothing to do with terrorism or with those groups, " she says.

Marcela speaks with confidence and character when asked about her religion. But how did this 37-year-old mother of three children aged 19, 13 and 12 and lover of makeup and fashion, think of Islam as a way of life?

"I am separated, I was a very young mom and I always said in my life that everything was very difficult. I had a time when I think I was missing God, so I started looking for answers. I started studying religions. I never understood the trinity, I did not understand Jesus as God, so Islam made sense," she says.

Although she found negativity on the part of her family, friends and even other Muslims with whom she spoke on the networks, Marcela was sure that it was what she needed to achieve a change. She was persistent, continued to investigate and took as a guide several YouTube channels such as 'Dawah Addict', dedicated to guiding people who are beginning in this religion.

"Then I found on Facebook a group of Muslims in Latin America. There were some people in Bogota and they invited me to the mosque and I started the more formal process," she says.

That is how she arrived at the Istanbul mosque, located on 45th street with 14-81, in Bogota, where about 110 people, including 60 women, attend. Now visit this temple every Friday, the sacred day for the Muslims, along with their sons Samuel and Mariana, who also became.

In this same place she married on February 7 with Riz Khan, an Englishman of Afghan origin and Muslim by birth, who met online. "We started talking on December 14, 2015. On December 19 he came to Bogota, he was there for four days and before leaving he told me that he had come with the purpose of knowing me and that he wanted to get married. In Islam there is no courtship and contact is not allowed, everything went until marriage. I thought it was going to be difficult, but it's as if we had known each other for a long time," she says.

"There is a very nice legend that says that love is madness that ends in marriage, in Islam love is madness that begins with marriage," she adds.

In December of this year Marcela will go to live in Qatar to establish her life there with her husband and children. For now they manage the relationship at a distance and the two make trips to see each other.

This is your day in Bogota

Marcela's day starts very early. Muslims perform five prayers a day and the first one must be before sunrise. So around 4:30 a.m. start your day He works at the pharmaceutical company Pfizer as assistant to the Regional Presidency of Oncology. Contrary to other scenarios, in her office she has felt supported and supported against her religious beliefs. "There is a very strong policy on diversity and inclusion, my colleagues are very understanding, they always adjust the lunch so I can do the noon prayer or if I do not have a room they help me look for it," she says.

"I have learned about the Muslim culture, she has taught me how to be a strong person in an environment where it is not so easy to be different" says Daniela Carrillo, one of her co-workers.

However, Marcela can not deny that in her daily life she has felt discriminated against. "One may think that it is not so notorious because in Latin America there is no such strong 'Islamophobia', but there is discrimination. My daughter had to be changed from school because they were bullying her. You also notice it when you enter a place or when you are on the street because people do not take the time to investigate, "he says.

On Fridays she leaves a little earlier from his office to meet her children in the mosque. There they have lunch and pray at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. The women must remain on the second floor, separated from the men, but they have a television to follow the prayer, led by the Sheikh. During the afternoon there are talks on different topics such as marriage, the Koran, Islamic legislation, among others. Those who spend their Friday afternoons in this place describe it as the best time to feel in family and togetherness.

Fulfilling prayers is one of the five pillars of Islam. They must also manifest their belief in God; donate 2.5 percent of the money they have; perform Ramadan, a 30-day fast where you can only eat after 6 in the afternoon and before the sun rises (this year began on June 6); and make the pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime, if you have the means and the health.

The role of women in Islam

"Seeing the perception that the Muslim woman should stay at home and that she can not study is not real. The responsibility of women with family, society and work is very important. The great Muslim heads of women have made many important advances with respect to science and education, " says Marcela.

According to Carlos Sanchez, imam (religious counselor) of the Istanbul mosque, "in Islam, the woman is the head of the family and society, so God says that man can not cause anguish, stress or anxiety, but protect and safeguard it The right thing is for the woman to want to have her home and know that she will not be abandoned, she can not be put to work to pay for electricity, water, telephone or family food. but it's for your own benefit. "

For Fanny Ochoa, director of the Center for Higher Islamic Studies in Colombia, "the main foundation of what the Quran raises is not known or has not been updated and that is why we are left with the interpretation of machismo and patriarchalism. reinterpreted by women to remove that burden of tradition ".

"For example, the imposition of clothing is handled as an identifying and obligatory element and in Islam there is no coercion to religion, nor an imposition," adds Ochoa, who says that wearing the hijab should be an internal decision of the woman .

Marcela agrees with Fanny when she says that using this garment is a very personal issue. "It is my relationship with God and no one should be affected. For example, my husband has never cared if I use it or not, "he says.

"The hijab allows people to assault or discriminate against me, but also to come and ask me and so there is more tolerance," she says.

For Marcela, the most important thing is that this religion has allowed her to see the problems as proofs that must be overcome in order to obtain blessings. Feel assurance that your children will never lose the values ??of integrity they have reaped thanks to their beliefs and ensure that they were converted because they truly felt it in their hearts. His 12-year-old son Samuel sends a very clear message: "I tell children of my age not to believe everything they say about Islam because it can be a lie. We always complain about many things and when we convert to Islam we begin to thank and stop being spiteful. "
