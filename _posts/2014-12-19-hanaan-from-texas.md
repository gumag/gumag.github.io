Assalam Alaikom!

My birth name is Brooke but I go by Hanaan now. I was raised in a Southern All-American family. I partied, I drank, I dated, asthagfurAllah. I was never taught the purpose in life. I moved around a lot after I turned 18, meeting Muslims everywhere I went.

I was so drawn to Muslims and I never knew why. I started studying and eventually it came to a day that I felt I couldn't go another day without being Muslim, I took Shahada that night with a Muslim friend after watching Ahmed Deedat and Yusuf Estes videos.

The next day was Jummah, and to my surprise my American friend took her Shahadah the same day! I started to wear hjiab every day after that.

Of course my family was not happy, and I lost a lot of friends, but I just remember Allah swt does not give us anything we can't handle.

Today I am an American hijabi and I can honestly say I could not imagine myself without Islam.
