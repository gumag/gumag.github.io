Old Testament

In the book of Genesis, Noah condemns Canaan (Son of Ham) to perpetual servitude: "Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers" (Gn 9:25). T. David Curp notes that this episode has been used to justify racialized slavery, since "Christians and even some Muslims eventually identified Ham's descendents as black Africans".

Anthony Pagden argued that "This reading of the Book of Genesis merged easily into a medieval iconographic tradition in which devils were always depicted as black. Later pseudo-scientific theories would be built around African skull shapes, dental structure, and body postures, in an attempt to find an unassailable argument—rooted in whatever the most persuasive contemporary idiom happened to be: law, theology, genealogy, or natural science—why one part of the human race should live in perpetual indebtedness to another."

The Canaanites settled in Canaan, rather than Africa, where Ham's other sons, Cush and Put, most likely settled. Noah's curse only applied to Canaan, and according to biblical commentator, Gleason L. Archer, this curse was fulfilled when Joshua conquered Canaan in 1400 BC.[Deuteronomy 20:10-16] Although there is considerable doubt about the nature and extent of the conquest described in the early chapters of the book of Joshua, the post-Flood story did supply a rationale for the subjugation of the Canaanites. It is possible that the naming of 'Canaan' in the post-Flood story is itself a reflection of the situation of warfare between peoples in the time when the written form of the story took shape.

Some forms of servitude, customary in ancient times, were condoned by the Torah.

Hebrews would be punished if they beat a slave causing death within a day or two,[Exodus 21:20-21] and would have to let a slave go free if they destroyed a slave's eye or tooth,[Exodus 26-27] force a slave to work on the Sabbath,[Exodus 23:12] return an escaped slave of another people who had taken refuge among the Israelites,[Deuteronomy 23:15] or to slander a slave.[Proverbs 30:10] It was common for a person to voluntarily sell oneself into slavery for a fixed period of time either to pay off debts or to get food and shelter.[Leviticus 25:35] It was seen as legitimate to enslave captives obtained through warfare.  Deuteronomy 20:10-16

The Bible does set minimum rules for the conditions under which slaves were to be kept. Slaves were to be treated as part of an extended family;[Deuteronomy 16:14] they were allowed to celebrate the Sukkot festival,[Deuteronomy 16:14] and expected to honor Shabbat.[Exodus 20:10] Israelite slaves could not be compelled to work with rigor,[Leviticus 25:43][ Leviticus 25:53] and debtors who sold themselves as slaves to their creditors had to be treated the same as a hired servant.[Leviticus 25:39] If a master harmed a slave in one of the ways covered by the lex talionis, the slave was to be compensated by manumission;[ Exodus 21:26-27] if the slave died within 24 to 48 hours, it was to be avenged[Exodus 21:20-21]

Non-Israelite slaves could be enslaved indefinitely and were to be treated as inheritable property.[ Leviticus 25:44-46] 


New Testament

slaves were also told to obey their masters "with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ." (Ephesians 6:5 KJV) [Archer (1982), Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties, pp. 86-87]

Avery Robert Dulles said that "Jesus, said not a word against slavery as a social institution", and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either.[43]

In a paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that, while he often encountered it, "not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery"; moreover a number of his stories are set in a slave/master situation, and involve slaves as key characters. Giles notes that these circumstances were used by pro-slavery apologists in the 19th century to suggest that Jesus approved of slavery.[44]

In several Pauline epistles, and the First Epistle of Peter, slaves are admonished to obey their masters, as to the Lord, and not to men.[45][46][47][48][49]

Peter was aware that there were masters that were gentle and masters that were harsh; slaves in the latter situation were to make sure that their behaviour was beyond reproach, and if punished for doing right, to endure the suffering as Christ also endured it.[51]

Paul's instructions to slaves in the Epistle of Paul to Titus: "Tell slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect; they are not to talk back, not to pilfer, but to show complete and perfect fidelity, so that in everything they may be an ornament to the doctrine of God our Savior."[57]

the Roman church often condemned with anathema slaves who fled from their masters, and refused them Eucharistic communion.[70]

church mission activities in the Caribbean were directly supported by the proceeds of slave ownership was under the terms of a charitable bequest in 1710 to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. The Codrington Plantations in Barbados, were granted to the Society to fund the establishment of Codrington College. In the first decade of ownership, several hundred slaves at the plantation estates were branded on their chests, using the traditional red hot iron, with the word Society, to signify their ownership by the Christian organisation.


St Thomas Aquinas considered slavery as a result of sin and was justifiable for that reason.[86][87]
St Thomas Aquinas in mid-thirteenth century accepted the new Aristotelian view of slavery as well as the titles of slave ownership derived from Roman civil law, and attempted — without complete success — to reconcile them with Christian patristic tradition. He takes the patristic theme ... that slavery exists as a consequence of original sin and says that it exists according to the "second intention" of nature; it would not have existed in the state of original innocence according to the "first intention" of nature; in this way he can explain the Aristotelian teaching that some people are slaves "by nature" like inanimate instruments, because of their personal sins; for since the slave cannot work for his own benefit slavery is necessarily a punishment. He accepts the symbiotic master-slave relationship as being mutually beneficial. There should be no punishment without some crime, so slavery as a penalty is a matter of positive law.[84] St Thomas' explanation continued to be expounded at least until the end of the 18th century.[85]

George Whitefield, famed for his sparking of the Great Awakening of American evangelicalism, campaigned, in the Province of Georgia, for the legalisation of slavery,[115][116]. Slavery was legalised in Georgia in 1751 due in large part to Whitefield's efforts. He bought enslaved Africans to work on his plantation and the orphanage he established in Georgia. Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon inherited these slaves and kept them in bondage.[115]

Jefferson Davis, President, Confederate States of America[118] said: "[Slavery] was established by decree of Almighty God...it is sanctioned in the Bible, in both Testaments, from Genesis to Revelation...it has existed in all ages, has been found among the people of the highest civilization, and in nations of the highest proficiency in the arts."


Richard Furman, President, South Carolina Baptist Convention[119][120]: "the right of holding slaves is clearly established in the Holy Scriptures, both by precept and example."

In 1837, southerners in the Presbyterian denomination joined forces with conservative northerners to drive the antislavery New School Presbyterians out of the denomination. In 1844, the Methodist Episcopal Church split into northern and southern wings over the issue of slavery. In 1845, the Baptists in the South formed the Southern Baptist Convention due to disputes with Northern Baptists over slavery and missions.[121]
Some members of fringe Christian groups like the Christian Identity movement, the Ku Klux Klan (an organization dedicated to the "empowerment of the white race"), and Aryan Nations still argue that slavery is justified by Christian doctrine today.


in 1667, Virginia's assembly enacted a bill declaring that baptism did not grant freedom to slaves.

Some Portuguese and Spanish explorers were quick to enslave the indigenous peoples encountered in the New World. 

Christianity has existed for so long in Africa (most notably in Ethiopia) that it is considered by some scholars as an "indigenous, traditional and African religion,"[128]

Harvard Divinity School's Jacob K. Olupona states that "Christianity was deeply culpable in the African slave trade, inasmuch as it consistently provided a moral cloak for the buying and selling of human beings."[131]

Archbishop of Baltimore, Maryland John Carroll, had two black servants - one free and one a slave. The Society of Jesus in Maryland owned slaves who worked on the community's farms. The Jesuits began selling off their slaves in 1837. 

Bishop John England of Charleston actually wrote several letters to the Secretary of State under President Martin Van Buren explaining that the Pope, in In supremo, did not condemn slavery but only the slave trade, the buying and selling of slaves, not the owning of them. No Pope had ever condemned "domestic slavery" as it had existed in the United States. As a result of this interpretation, no American bishop spoke out in favor of abolition before the Civil War.[152]

The Bishop of Charleston[citation needed] declared that, while Catholic tradition opposed slave trading, it had nothing against slavery.

Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, taught that slavery of black Africans was required through both the Curse of Cain and the Curse of Ham and warned those who were trying to free the slaves that they were going against the decrees of God.[158] 

Mormons canonized several scriptures giving credence to the pro-slavery interpretation of the Curse of Ham[161] and received scriptures teaching against interfering with the slaves of others.[157] A few slave owners joined the church, and took their slaves with them to Nauvoo.[164]

there were several prominent slave owners in the leadership of the LDS Church, including Abraham O. Smoot and Apostle Charles C. Rich.[169] The LDS Church also accepted slaves as tithing.[170][171]:34 The Mormon settlement of San Bernardino openly practiced slavery under the leadership of Apostles Charles C. Rich and Amasa M. Lyman, despite being in the free state of California. They were freed by a judge who determined that the slaves were kept ignorant of the laws and their rights.[172]

Brigham Young also encouraged members to participate in the Indian slave trade. While visiting the members in Parowan, he encouraged them to "buy up the Lamanite children as fast as they could". He argued that by doing so, they could educate them and teach them the gospel, and in a few generations the Lamanites would become white and delightsome.[173] Mormons often referred to Indians as Lamanites, reflecting their belief that the Indians were descended from the Lamanites, who were a cursed race discussed in the Book of Mormon. Chief Walkara, one of the main slave traders in the region, was baptized in the church, and received talking papers from Apostle George A. Smith that wished him success in trading Piede children.[174]


Mormons also enslaved Indian prisoners of war. As they began expanding into Indian territory, they often had conflicts with the local residents. After expanding into Utah Valley, Young issued the extermination order against the Timpanogos, resulting in the Battle at Fort Utah, where many Timpanogos women and children were taken into slavery. Some were able to escape, but many died in slavery.[175] After expanding into Parowan, Mormons attacked a group of Indians, killing around 25 men and taking the women and children as slaves.[176]:274
