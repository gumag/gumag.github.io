**By Dima Abu-Naqoos**

As a kid growing up my parents would always remind me that this world that we live is short and temporary and that we must strive to do that which will please our Lord. For there will come a day where we will all leave this world and return to our creator.

Allah has promised us in the Holy Quran “Every soul shall taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned.” (21;35) and it also mentioned  that “To Allah we belong to Allah we shall return” (2:156). 

I always used to think that death won’t come to people at a young age. Always thought it’s something that happens to you when you get old. I always use to pray for my grandparents asking God to bless them with a long healthy life so I could spend more time with them, build more memories and just enjoy the comfort that they provide. 

Never have I thought that I, myself, might not live long enough to see them again. The past few years I have lived to witness young people pass away. I cannot begin to express the feelings that go through my body. But what’s even worse is that such events had to happen in order for others and I to truly wake up to reality. I keep denying it, denying all these deaths, hoping that I shall soon wake up from this dream and realize it was only a nightmare. 

But deep down I know that this is not the case and that this is eternal. Memories and flashbacks playing over and over in my head, every second spent, every word that was said, even things I thought I wouldn’t remember seem to come back to me. The thought of death is always running through my head. 

Everything I do now makes me wonder what if I die in this state. Am I ready to face my Lord? Am I ready to close my book of accounts? Have I also prepared the three things that shall help me even after death? Have I spent in the way of Allah, and people will still benefit from it even after my death (Sadaqa Jaariya). Have I spread some knowledge about Islam that people will still talk about after my death(Ilmun Naafe'ah). Have I left a righteous child (of mine) who shall pray to Allah asking him to forgive me and grant me the highest level of paradise (Ibnun Saleh).  

I bow my head down, asking you oh Allah to help me, to forgive me and to guide me and all those whom I love so dearly to the straight path. As a youth, striving to be a practicing Muslim is surely tough; we often forget what it means to actually be a Muslim. We get so caught up in this world, and society wont stop influencing us on who to be and how to act. 

When we encounter death we get shaken a bit and start trying hard to be at our best but as time passes by we seem to slowly go back to our old habits. As if we are safe now, not thinking we might be next. It surely is terrifying, just the thought of it makes me weep like a baby. 

Weep for all the sins I have committed, for every prayer I missed. Weep for the times my actions were unjust towards my Lord. Weep for all the people I mistreated and for all the times I gave my parents a hard time. Weep for how much Allah has given me although I don’t deserve anything not even a grain of sand. Weep for the times I was ungrateful, unthankful, and selfish. Weep for all the wrong that I have done, yet Allah never leaves my side, always there to help me, always there to listen to me, always there to forgive me and give me another chance. He gives me hope when I seem to lose hope in everything including myself. 

Allah has said “Tell them, (O Prophet): “My servants who have committed excesses against themselves, do not despair of Allah's Mercy. Surely Allah forgives all sins. He is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.” (39:53). So never underestimate the mercy of your Lord, pray for yourself and for all your fellow Muslim brothers and sisters whether they are dead or alive.
