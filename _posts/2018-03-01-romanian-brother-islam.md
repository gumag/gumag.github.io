I am 20 years old I was born in Romania in a Romanian and Greek family. My family immigrated to Canada when I was 7 and half years old and I lived here for most of my life. 

My family were practicing Christians and so was I. I really loved God and the Church but I always had a problem with the trinity. One day, my parents had a conflict with the pastor so we stopped attending Church. That's when I started searching for God. I first explored Christiannity, I investigated every christian sect but they always had this problem of original sin and the trinity that I could not wrap my hands around.

I then explored Judaism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism etc. Then One day I Started Reading the Qur'an and that's when my eyes opened. This was what I was searching for!.  Nonetheless I wasn't finished with my searches yet. I met a Shia guy and he introduced me to Shiism and I immeadiatly felt a deep reverence for The Holy Prophet (Sawas) , Ali (Kw), Hussein(Ra) and the whole of Ahlul-Bayt.

I Then took my Shahada at the Iranian Mosque. I really felt that I was on the right Path of Allah(Swt). Being from Eastern Europe it was easier at the time to accept shiism because sunni Islam was seen as the "religion of the Turks" so I felt confortable. But I started finding myself unconfortable with certain beliefs like the disappearance of Imam Mahdi for more than 1000 years, Mut'a and the position on the Sahaba.

How could the whole of the companions betray RasoulAllah(Sawas) when people like Abu Bakr (Ra) came to the religion when it was in its weakest form and had nothing to gain from it except if he truly loved Allah(Swt) and RasoulAllah(Sawas). There are still other issues that made me doubt Shiism like the fact that the Shii books of Hadith are mostly  unreliable.

Finally Elhamdulilah Allah(Swt) guided me towards Ahlus Sunnah wal Jam3a and I feel like I finally found my place :)
