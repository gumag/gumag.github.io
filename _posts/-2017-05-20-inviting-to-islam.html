God created mankind and made it live on earth but did not leave it in vain. He revealed to him in various ages a method of walking on his guidance. The goodness and happiness of mankind in every time and place is to follow the approach of God and put forth what others.
Islam is the last of the heavenly religions and the Qur'an is the last of the heavenly books and Muhammad is the last of the Prophets and Apostles. God has commanded him to inform this religion to all people: (And this is revealed to me by the Quran).
Â (Say: O people, I am the Messenger of Allah to all of you).
The call to Islam is the best work, because of the guidance of people to the straight path and guide them to what pleased them in this world and the Hereafter (and better words of those who called to God and worked good and said I am a Muslim) Separated / 33.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that his message in life, and the message of his followers is to call to Allaah. He said: "Say:" These are my ways. I call upon Allah on the insight of me and those who follow me, Yusuf.
And the Muslims in general and the scholars in particular, are enjoined to call Islam, as the Almighty said: "Let there be a nation of you who call for good, and enjoin good and forbid evil, and these are the successful ones."
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "Pray for me, even if it is a sign." Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3461.
The call to Allah is a great message and a great task, as it is to invite people to worship God alone and move them from darkness to light and to plant good, the place of evil and the right place of falsehood, so it needs those who do it to science, wisdom, patience, dreams, softness and kindness. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): "Pray to your Lord's wisdom and good exhortation and argue with them that it is better that your Lord is better informed than those who are misguided.
And the preacher may be exposed in his call to controversy, especially with the people of the book has ordered us when it comes to controversy, to argue with the best is by soft and soft and presented the principles of Islam as pure pure purely without coercion as the Almighty said: (Do not argue with the people of the book only They are the best, but those who have wronged them, and say, Surely, Who is revealed to us, and is revealed to you, and to our God and your God, and one to Him we are Muslims.
And to call to Allaah is a great virtue and a great reward. He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "Whoever calls for guidance has the reward of the reward of those who follow him. This does not diminish their wages, and he who calls for misguidance was iniquity, like the sins of his followers. From their sins something. "Narrated by Muslim, 2674.
If the physical construction needs effort and patience until it is completed, building the souls and carrying them to the right needs patience and sacrifice. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called for Islam, and he repented of the infidels' harm. The Jews and the hypocrites insulted him and lied to him. That he is a magician or a madman and accused him of being a poet or a priest and peace be upon him on all of this until his victory in God, and showed his religion to the preacher to follow him (Vassbr that the promise of God is right and do not Istkvk who do not believe).
