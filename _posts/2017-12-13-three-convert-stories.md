## Attracted by Muslim Manners (American sister Jill)

My introduction to Islam first and foremost came from Muslims.

The first time I met a Muslim person was when I was working in college at a
restaurant that was owned by a Palestinian.

I was a waitress and a lot of the waitresses including myself were Americans,
while a lot of the pizza drivers and the owners were Arab Muslims.

So I thought to myself:

"Wow, look at these gentlemen, when they laugh they laugh from the bottom of
their hearts, they shake their hands warmly with each other."

I was very intrigued by an impression like "They are so different", but in a good way.

Naturally I became interested in Islam just from meeting those people. So I took a class in college about Middle Eastern history.

Then I started to understand more the political background of that part of the
world as well as the religious background, and I was so intrigued by learning
about Islam from the historical perspective, as well as being around the
people I knew who were Muslims and whom I found something different about
their hearts.

At the same time, I got a lot of help at my class from my future husband, the
gentleman who became my husband in the future. His name is Sufian. Sufian
always presented Islam to me from a very knowledgeable base, and never emotional.

I was always looking for what's wrong with this religion. There has to be
something wrong with it. So I would question and I would question and he would
always say to me "Jill, Islam is logical".

Every single thing that you want to point out as a problem with Islam, like
why do women have to cover their hair or why did men take more than one wife, he would always have the logical
explanation for it.

Learning the logical explanations for these stereotypical problems that I
think westerners see with Islam, when you learn the history behind it or the
reasoning behind it you can't argue. In fact it is the opposite; you see the beauty behind it.

For me, Islam was a gradual acceptance. I wasn't the type of person who would
just accept it blindly. So I needed to study it on my own and alhamdulillah
(praise be to God) my husband was a good teacher for me, but beyond my husband
I would take classes.

And I think also becoming friends with other Muslim women and eventually
attending the halaqah (study group) that I go to, I think fully embracing Islam was a
journey for me.

I haven't fully arrived, but I think again in Islam you never do fully arrive.
In Islam, for the rest of your life until the day you die, In-Shaa-Allah you
will be progressing and learning.

That's in short how I became a Muslim.


## 9/11 Sparked My Attention (Russian sister)

The first time that I knew about Islam was through 
reading a book. Few months later, the 9/11 tragedy took place
which highly caught my attention. I started to ask who are those people and
what do they want to show to the World through that extreme act?

So I started to study Islam and I discovered that Islam is so
bigger and larger than what the media says to us especially western media.
This was the first contact with Islam.

For 2 years, I studied Islam by myself because in my country it's too
difficult to find Muslims to help. After two years, I got a Quran and I read it so fast.

I remember that I finished reading it, of course its interpretation in my
language, on a Thursday night. So, I thought like I was making a small shirk
because I was putting my parents above God.

I didn't convert at that time because they didn't like it in terms of wearing
a scarf and such things. So I thought tomorrow I will go to the mosque and convert.

Then the next day, I took the table's cover, I put it on my head and I went to
the mosque. It was very funny because everybody was looking and wondering what
I was wearing, but alhamdulillah I'm a Muslim now.

The position of woman in Islam is very important to me because through the
whole of my life I thought the position of women in western
countries is so hard.

I was an engineer and I worked like a man and I earned like the third of a
man's salary even if we had to work outside home and inside home taking care
of the family. So it was too hard and wasn't normal. Every person whether
woman or man has his/her roles and it's very important because we can't take
all of the work by ourselves, so we must share this.


## A Journey of Spiritual Growth (American brother)

The things that I find in Islam to be attractive have actually changed as I've grown.

I've been a Muslim now alhamdulillah for over 25 years. My initial attraction
to Islam was for instance the sense of brotherhood of humanity.

In the United States, we have a long tradition of 
racial separation and segregation- which nowadays has kind of
dissolved for a number of reasons- but I find that when I met Muslims and
later when I traveled to the Muslim world, this absolute disregard for the
outward features of human beings whether it be the color or other things, and
that mankind was actually united together under a single religion.

When I first embraced Islam, it was something very straightforward and very
simple kind of theology and doctrine. But as I've grown I started to read more
and discover more and taking a more spiritual path.

I now find what I love about Islam is that I see as if I'm standing on the
beach of this vast endless ocean, and now when I read the Quran it's not the
same eyes that I read with 25 years ago. It's this endless sea of meanings
with answers for everything.

This really amazes me and keeps my zeal going. So that question has changed as
I'm changing and I imagine in the future insha'Allah this may change as well.
