The story of Wayne Bennett is a vivid embodiment of one of Prophet Muhammad's hadeeths, where he confirms that when God wants something He makes easy ways for it. This young man was born and raised in a Christian environment, and moved between churches in search for psychological stability. At one point in his life he was addicted to drugs and joined gangs. Then God opened his heart to Islam, and sent his way someone who showed him the light of guidance. Suffice to say that 21 young Americans accepted Islam at his hands.

Here is an interview with Mr Wayne Bennett:

**Tell us about yourself?**

My Muslim name is Hudhaifah Abdul Rahim, I am from the United States, born in Vildova, a town about two hours drive north of New York. I grew up in a Catholic church, and went to a Catholic school. My father was in the army so we traveled a lot. My family traveled to Japan when I was a teenager. I stayed there for 5 years and practiced karate and martial arts. We left Japan in 1973. We returned to Veldovia, and then things changed. I lived a great part of my life in a residential complex. When my father retired things completely changed for me: I joined gangs where drugs and fights were daily routine especially at night. I wanted to be in those gangs, many youth want to be in a gang and live like criminals.

**What did you do before Islam?**

I was a drummer and music was important in my life as much as women, drugs and alcohol, but there was always this question in my mind: why do people use drugs, go to bars, and listen to loud music? I believe that there is a void in the human heart, and this void can be filled only with Islam, no doubt, but people try to fill this void with other things like Christianity. But these things can not fill that void; because they aren't true. So people try music, drugs and dangerous sports where a simple mistake can cost a person his life.

**What event in your life made a big difference?**

There were many things, but the most prominent event was when my mother sent me to college. There my life started to change. I was a Catholic in the past, but then I became a Baptist. I did not find the thing I wanted in the Baptist Church so I turned back to Karate and practiced for a period of time until I got bored.

At that point I began to practice Buddhism, not the one involving worship of idols, but the one where you sit and meditate to make the mind and body communicate with the universe. This was in the first and second years of college.
After that I worked on a ship, and I consider this as a gift from God to get rid of many of the things that I was doing in the past: on the ship there were no drugs or booze or women.

The captain was a native Indian, from the indigenous people of America. He once told me "I feel like you're looking for the truth. Well, I have a book I want you to read." He gave me a book that I kept for thirty years. This book talks about the life of Buddha and how he became an educated and accomplished person.

It is a beautiful book and I enjoyed it a lot. After I finished reading this book, I thought: Yes, Buddhism is what I'm looking for. That is because my meditations started to improve, my way of thinking more mature, I stayed away from alcohol. I was there on board the ship seeing God's nature, and really enjoying it and I thought: "It's really an amazing book."

**What happened after you liked this book?**

I wanted to return the book to the captain but he gave it to me as a gift, and then asked me: Do you know Malcolm X? I said: No. He said: No problem, this is a picture of Malcolm X, and then gave me another book also as a gift. Reading this book really puzzled my mind, and when I reached the chapter that speaks about when Malcolm X went to perform Hajj, and how it helped him learn the true Islam. That's when I realized that this is what I was looking for and that I want to become a Muslim, and that I want to live the life of Islam, which has no drugs or gangs. That is really the life I want. Malcolm X talked about brotherhood in Islam, in fact I believed in the existence of God and his oness somewhat. Before reading this book I had no problem that Jesus is God or not, but after reading it the picture became clearer in my mind and everything was put in its proper place.

**What after you became aware of the new image of Islam?**

I found a Quran and some other books about Islam on the ship. After reading these books and Malcolm X's book, I found out that we were in Ramadan, and learned that I must fast, but I did not know how to fast so I stopped eating for three days and just drunk juice. During these three days news were spreading on the ship that Bennett did not eat for three days and that he was breaking the rules by talking about Religion, and Islam in particular. So I was transferred to another ship.

I thought this was bad for me, but in fact there was good in what was happening. When they transferred me to the new ship I felt rejected and I was very sad but thank God I moved to another ship close to San Francisco, and it was a Friday so I decided to go to San Francisco to look for Muslims there. I stopped a Taxi and asked the driver to take me to one of the jazz music clubs. He said: Sorry I don't know any of these clubs because I'm Muslim. Subhanallah! The first person I met was a Muslim. I did not believe what was happening because he was not only Muslim but also a Sunni who had a good understanding of Islam. His name was Muhammad Abdullah. It's also known in America that no one invites a stranger to his home, but this person with his beautiful smile invited to his home, and we eat dinner together. I was very impressed!

**How did you get started in Islam?**

It was a blessing from God first, then because of this Sheikh who took me to the mosque; to do the Isha prayer.
in the mosque, the muezzin began to recite the adhaan.
I was in a state of joy that cannot be described, and this Sheikh was telling me about Islam,
There was a station close to the ship where I was working so I was meeting with him a lot during the day. Every day after 5pm I went to the mosque and one day we were sitting in the mosque and talking. The imam said to me: When do you want to enter Islam? I was surprised by his question and said: I've been praying with you for nearly a month in this mosque, and I know how to read Al Fatihah and you ask me: When do you want to be a Muslim ? He replied: You must say the Shahadah "I certify that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God". This was in 1979.

**What did you do after the shahadah?**

I called my mom right after I took the shahadah and said "I became Muslim"
she was shocked and stayed silent for a miniute or two. Then she asked "You became what?". I said "I am now a Muslim"
She started to scream and called my father. My father came and picked up the phone. I told him that I had entered Islam. He could not believe it and said, "You seem to be under the influence of drugs." I said, "Dad, I'm not drunk, but I became a Muslim."

**Is there a difference between your life before Islam and your life after Islam?**

I felt the difference between Islam and Christianity. Before Islam I was very social and I was always involved in all activities related to music or dance. Now I wear a dress and put a rag on my head - as they say - and everyone wants to know what happened to me, and what changed me when I was away from them. I told them: I am a Muslim now. I did it because I had to protect myself, so that people know that there has been a change in my life; I will not do a lot of the things I was doing before. At the university a lot of students started avoiding me and would change course whenever they see me outside.

**Did you call for Islam after God guided you?**

I started to adhere to the teachings of Islam, and I realized that the Muslim is a mirror of his religion in front of non-Muslims. Alhamdulillah, Allah used me to guide 21 students from my university to Islam. I remember I was talking to  Islamic preacher Siraj Wahhaj and told him "I think I am not a good enough Muslim; God has guided only 21 men through me." He looked at me in astonishment and said "21? It's a good number". We were going to houses, knocking on doors and talking to people about Islam.
