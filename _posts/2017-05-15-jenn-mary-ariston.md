I am Jenn Mary “Sittie Jennah” Ariston.
I was born and raised as Roman Catholic. I can say, before I was literally afraid and uncomfortable with Muslims until adulthood.

Assalamo alaykum wa Rahmatullah ta’ala wa barakatuh!

My first time exposed to Muslims was in college because of common friends, those days were we used to go party and drink, typical Christian. There was one time that a Maranao, friend of my friend (Maranao; a Muslim tribe in the Philippines), I asked him about Islam, due to my curiosity about their religion, and too since I found him very nice. His explanation changed my views. He said, God perfected Islam. Islam is Peace and a way of Life. He cited many examples picturing Islam being a very beautiful religion and why one can easily conclude that this is the true religion.

He further said, we Muslims are humans too just like you Christians. We often make mistakes. We also have this freedom to choose and free will. We do whatever we want, either good or bad. It is up to us, but in the end there is Hellfire or Heaven. 

Then he quoted, “Not all Muslims are bad and not all Christians are good”. Look at us Muslims; blame everything to us and not to Islam because Islam has nothing to do with our negative actions. Instead, Islam is the peaceful way of life. It teaches us to do good and be of patience. Wars, violence and crimes have nothing to do with Islam; they are not part of Islam. Then he explained “jihad”, struggle in the way of Allah. Maa Shaa Allah! to me that topic was very interesting!

It all started there then I did my research, read books, internet, etc. Until I read the Life of Rasullullah (peace and Mercy of Allah be upon him). While reading, I felt my chest is slowly shrinking, it’s like my heart was being crumpled turning into pieces until I realized my eyes got teary. Subhanallah! I fall in love to Islam!

I didn’t embrace Islam right away because I was still considering my family’s feelings, and observing their reactions and even our situation. I knew they wouldn’t understand and will not accept it, coz my family is a devoted Roman Catholic. Days went on, my craving to become a Muslim is increasing, and too the pressure from my family. I can feel their opposition but I still need to pursue my plan to embrace Islam, since in our house they call me hard-headed so I used that excuse. 

I then embraced Islam April 5, 2013, Friday after Jum’ah prayer. Alhamdulillah! I am now a Muslim. There are lot of trials Alhamdulillah but I need to stay firm and strong for my faith. One thing I can say the moment I embraced Islam is that, that feeling of guilt and conscience of my past sins is somehow reduced, I felt total ease inside of me. The Prophet (peace and Mercy of Allah be upon him) guarantee when a man sincerely go back to his Lord his past sins will be erased and his record will be replaced of that of the record of a baby, he will be like of the newborn having no sins.

AlhamduliLLah! Being a muslim I can say I have now have peace of mind, coz I know I am now on the right track. Unlike before in my past life, I felt there is something missing. There are many things before that I don’t understand that Alhamdulillah now I understand. I am so much thankful and feel blessed to be chosen and guided to the right path. I was chosen to become a Muslim, coz none can guide except Allah. 

Alhamdulillah! And I will treasure this opportunity given to me by Allah; I will always embrace it till my death!
InshaAllah!
