I was born and raised a Muslim, Allahamdulliah. I have lived in America all my life, being born and raised here as well. MashaAllah. I love America; it's my home. Growing up I was always embarrassed about my religion. I was too afraid to wear my hijab in school. I always tried to "fit in" with all the other non Muslims around me. I would sometimes miss my salat and when I did pray, I would pray quickly to get it over with. 

I think living in a non Muslim community with no nearby mosque, has made me think I needed to be like everyone else. I've never tried eating haram (unlawful foods) nor have I ever tried alcohol. Allahamdulliah Allah SWT saved me from that. One night, I was just so depressed. I didn't like who I was, I didn't like trying to be someone I'm not. I felt like I was suffocating in my own body. I remember going outside for a walk one night and looking up at the stars and just asking Allah SWT to please guide me because I didn't know who I was at that point. I felt like I was someone I didn't even know. 

After that night, I noticed myself isolating from the dunya (world). I noticed myseld focusing more on my iman because it was so low. I noticed myself guarding my salat, respecting my parents, wearing my hijab out in public, telling people I am Muslim and being proud. I started inviting people to the deen and explaining to them the verses of the Holy Quran. I've noticed all this slowly coming together and today, Allahamdulliah! Allahamdulluah! Allahamdulliah! I can't say it enough.. THANK YOU ALLAH! - for guiding me, for forgiving me, most imporantly, for strengthing my Iman to be a better servant to you. 

I look around the world today, It makes me feel sorry for those who are struggling. People get drunk, make bad choices, women go out wearing bikinis, showing their body half naked. No no, Allahamdulliah Allah SWT saves us from these things, helps us understand that our body is meant to be covered, men and women and to guard our chasity. Stay away from alcohol that makes more sins happen. 

Islam teaches us life, how to live it peacefully, clean and right. I love knowing that our halal meat is prayed over with Allah's glorious name before we slaughter. I love how we help the poor or give sadaqah to those who need it in Allah's path. Allahamdulliah. I LOVE BEING MUSLIM! I love it so much. Allahamdulliah! It's a blessing to be Muslim. A religion so humble, peaceful, loving and clean. Anyone who is struggling, make dua to Allah. Communicate with Him. Don't get caught up in this dunya. It's not our home. We are only here for a test. Don't let shaytaan make you feel like you need to impress anyone on this Earth. We should only impress our Rabb (our Lord). 

Women if anyone harrasses you about hijab, always ask them, why is it okay for a nun to cover? Why is it acceptable for a Catholic priest or pope to cover? For us, it is okay too! Anyone who asks you why you don't drink alcohol, respond to them as to why do I need to? It's not life. It's just problems in a bottle. Istaagfaar. Ladies, we should strive to keep our sacred bodies guarded. We as Muslims, Allahamdulliah! Allah has taught us, showed us, guided us and be happy, thankful that you are in Islam with morals and respect because imagine your life without Islam? Where would you be? Istaagafaar. Please be constant in prayers salat, remember Allah. And do good for you never know when Azrael will come for you and death is given at any moment, not a second delayed.
