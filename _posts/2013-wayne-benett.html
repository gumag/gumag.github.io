The story of Wayne Bennett is a vivid embodiment of one of Prophet Muhammad's hadeeths, where he confirms that when God wants something He makes easy ways for it. This young man was born and raised in a Christian environment, and moved between churches in search for psychological stability. At one point in his life he was addicted to drugs and joined gangs. Then God opened his heart to Islam, and sent his way someone who showed him the light of guidance. Suffice to say that 21 young Americans accepted Islam at his hands.

Here is an interview of Mr Wayne Bennett featured on Alukah Network:

<p>
Tell us about yourself?<br>
My Muslim name is Hudhaifah Abdul Rahim, I am from the United States, born in Vildova, a town about two hours drive north from New York. I grew up in a Catholic church, and went to a Catholic school. My father was in the army so we traveled a lot. My family traveled to Japan when I was a teenager. I stayed there for 5 years and practiced karate and martial arts. We left Japan in 1973. We returned to Veldovia, and then things changed. I lived a great part of my life in a residential complex. When my father retired things completely changed for me: I joined gangs where drugs and fights were daily routine especially at night. I wanted to be in those gangs, many youth want to be in a gang and live like criminals.

What did you do before Islam?<br>
I was a drummer and music was important in my life as much as women, drugs and alcohol, but there was always this question in my mind: why do people use drugs, go to bars, and listen to loud music? I believe that there is a void in the human heart, and this void can be filled only with Islam, no doubt, but people try to fill this void with other things like Christianity. But these things can not fill that void; because they aren't true. So people try music, drugs and dangerous sports where a simple mistake can cost a person his life.
