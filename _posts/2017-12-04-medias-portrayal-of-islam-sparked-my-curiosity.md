My name is Slava, I'm from Siberia, Omsk- Southwest Russia. I was christened
as a Russian orthodox. I went to church maybe once or twice .. so the first time
for my christening and the second time, I can't remember why I went there.

Then by the time I reached the UK, I think I was a protestant Christian by
then... I was in church services committee at school, singing in the choir and
everything else.

The thing that attracted me most to
Islam is that it makes sense, not only overall but at that specific point
in time, it just made perfect sense to me.

It wasn't the most pleasant of times even though times were actually good, I
went through different financial stages with my family, going through life and
at that point in time, it was probably at its peak, it was the highest time...
things were good. But it was also the worst time for me looking back.

I got to a stage in life where I just thought "this is not possible, I just
can't keep doing this" time and time again and I often my studies were
slipping... everything else was just going backwards.

Being in London around that time, in 2005-2006, it was after the London
terror attacks and obviously the 2001 events, the
media was savage about Islam generally and I knew for
a fact that it simply can't be; you can't be painted in such a
picture where you have the complete extremes. It's only extreme here or
extreme there; it's got to be somewhere in the middle.

I'm quite a stubborn guy and when someone says "don't do something" I find 99
ways of trying to prove them wrong. So I sat down and I wanted to find out
what the religion was actually about.

What I found most interesting is that there was never really
pressure to become Muslim, it was just a whole lot
of information being thrown at you.

So from trying to experience fasting, I thought I'm going to try to do it, I'm
going to have a test drive... and it became just a period of complete
tranquility, I was so relaxed... yes I was hungry, I
was tired but I was just completely relaxed and I was at peace with myself...
and looking back, nothing else in this world can plug that gap.

I was at the London central mosque and I was looking for a person, I said
"well! How do I join this? How do I do this?"

So I did.

I can't really describe the feeling of it. As the years go on, the best
feeling I can think of to describe that moment is just
gratitude that I was actually put down on the right path and that all of the
concerns that I've had.

My biggest concern back then was how will my parents take it? How will my
friends take it? How everybody that I know, including my roommate at that
time, who was actually one of the biggest opponents of me joining Islam, how
would he take it?

All the friends that I've had previously who found out about it,
the real ones stayed, the flaky ones that I was concerned about flaked off.
What I'm concerned about now is what if my friends find out that I'm doing
this tractable work. Or what would people think of me when I'm spending so
much time in the mosque.

A lot of people ask "why Islam" and I
say, well, how can you deny something by way of religion where you give, and
the more you give the better you feel... you find yourself in things where you
think... I would have never done this five years ago.

Now that I've accepted Islam, I have a clear structure, clear guidelines. Nine
years ago when I accepted Islam, there wasn't half of the things that we have
now... every morning I wake up and there is some Islamic news on my phone,
because it's just set as an update. If I have some free time, I'll download a
podcast of an Islamic scholar.

And it's just fantastic! There is so much knowledge
around you, all you have to do is focus on it.

 **Advice:**

Find yourself a person who you consider to be a friend, open up to them and
tell them "Look, I'm doing this... I'm very worried... I'm afraid" and believe me
they will come to your aid more time than you can possibly think. They will
always there to guide you... they want to help you.

Remember, if you get someone to accept Islam and you are their door to Islam,
you get so many good deeds.
