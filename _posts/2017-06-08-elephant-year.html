"In the Name of God, The Most Merciful, The Most Compassionate.  Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the Men of the Elephant? Did He not make their guile to go astray? And sent down (in prey) birds in flocks casting down on them stones of baked clay and, so He rendered them like straw eaten up" <br>
(Quran chapter 105, The Elephant)

<p>
This verse from the Quran tells the story of a historical event which took place on the year that Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) was born.
</p>

<p>
Yemen back then was ruled by the Christian king Abraha who had built a big church in Yemen. He decided to destroy the Kaaba because he wanted the tribes of Arabia to make their pilgrimage to his church instead of to the Kaaba. Some other accounts say that the reason he wanted to destroy the Kaaba was because some Arab bedouin had entered the church and relieved himself inside. Whatever the reason Abraha marched towards Mecca with his army and elephants.
</p>

<p>
One Abrah's army reached the outskirts of Mecca, some of his men took 200 camels that belonged to Abdul-Mutalib (Prophet Mohammad's grandfather). Abdul-Muttalib, was a highly respected man and none among the Arabs enjoyed greater regard than he; he was known to stand by his word, and he was a model of generosity. Every time he slaughtered a camel, he would distribute its meat among men, break up the bones and throw them to the dogs, and the offal he would take to the mountains where the birds and the wild beasts could feed on them. He therefore was called, 'the feeder of men and wild beasts'.
</p>

<p>
On hearing about Abdul Muttalib high rank, Abraha called on him. Now Abdul-Muttalib was most impressive and dignified in his person, and perceiving this, Abraha found it unsuitable for Abdul-Muttalib to be seated beneath him. He also thought it imprudent for him to sit beside him on his throne, so he descended from his throne and sat with him on the carpet. He greeted him with all tokens of respect and looked him over. His dignity and appearance pleased him very much. He asked his interpreter to translate for him, and he was much taken by Abdul-Muttalib's conversation. In his heart he conceived the intention not to destroy the Kaaba for the sake of Abdul-Muttalib, and not raze the city.
</p>

<p>
He let the interpreter ask Abdul-Muttalib what favor he would ask of him, promising him to fulfill whatever it was. Abdul-Muttalib answered, "Yesterday they plundered and took away my two hundred camels; these I want returned to me." Abraha felt sad hearing these words from Abdul-Muttalib, and said to himself, "What a pity! This person apparently has not the wits to match his looks; his arrangements are not wise; here I am with a mighty army about to destroy that on which depends the whole fame and pride of Mecca. He could have asked me to spare it, I would have granted it to him for his sake; instead he asks me only for his 200 camels! If I went away and left the Kaaba intact, he would get back his two hundred camels in any case!" This he told the interpreter to tell Abdul-Muttalib. To this Abdul-Muttalib answered, "This house does not belong to me. It has an owner, and He knows very well how to protect it. He has no need of my protection, if He likes He will save it, if He likes He will let it be destroyed. That is none of my concern. All I want are my camels, they are my rightful property, let the king return them to me." So Abraha had the camels returned to him, and he led them back towards Mecca.
</p>

<p>
The next morning Abraha set out to wipe out Mecca. Abdul-Muttalib had ordered the inhabitants to leave town.  When Abraha's army reached Mecca Allah ordered the Ababil birds to fly against them. They came down by the sea. Each one of the birds carried three little bits of mud or stone, like peas or lentils, one in its beak and one in each claw. They came flying towards Mecca and hovered over the army. By the leave of Allah, a wind rose up from Hell and turned those bits of mud into stone, as clay is baked. While these stones were red-hot and glowing, they pelted the army of Abraha. No sooner they fell upon a man that they burnt their way into his body, so that he swelled up and burst. Abraha was hit on his head by a stone, and his whole body swelled, and he suffered greatly the whole journey back to Yemen where he died, in terrible agony.
