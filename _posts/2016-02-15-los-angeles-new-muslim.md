Salam. My name is Taqwa and I would like to share the story of how I became a Muslim.

I was born "Jennifer" in a dysfunctional household in Los Angeles. My mom had numerous boyfriends that came into her life and out many times. I never knew who my father was and eventually my mother got hooked on meth.

She became an absolute nightmare for me and my 2 younger siblings. I had to grow up very quickly. Sadly, I began to smoke, drink and cut myself due to all of the pain and pressure. I wanted to die. I ran away from home many times but always came back because of my younger siblings.

One day, I was pumping gas at a 76 stations and I was clearly flustered and for some reason I was unable to pump gas, an African American lady in traditional Islamic headwear approached me and offered to help me. While she walked towards me I remember immediately judging her in my mind.

I asked why she wore that thing on her head when it was so hot. She explained why and in such an eloquent manner that she really caught my attention. I know in my heart that she knew that I was going through pain and struggle and she offered dinner at her place. I declined but then as I walked away, I quickly turned around and said "ok"; she had a peaceful, angelic aura. I was very drawn to it.

This sweet and kind woman is the reason I pursued Islam. It has been a struggle but Kalimah is the reason why I am the better person that I am today. My life changed drastically, I am set to graduate college and start a career now. I wear hijab and I love it! My younger brother saw the beauty of Islam and took Shahada too! That day at the gas station changed my life.
