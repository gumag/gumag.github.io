Four lives, four different stories from these Spanish Catholics who decided to abandon the religion of their parents, and embrace a religion practiced by around 1,700,000 Muslims (3.6% of society) currently living in Spain.

José Ángel, Ana María, Consuelo and Álex are Spanish. Their parents, grandparents and ancestors were baptized Christians, they read the Bible and made communion as good Catholics. They were four fervent believers in Jesus who went to mass and even studied in Catholics schools ... until one day they began to doubt, so much so that they ended up taking the most important decision of their lives: to convert to Islam.

"Converting to Islam was the best decision I have made in my life," says José Ángel in a video, where his four friends agree that this decision changed them completely. Some made new friends, because going out at night to clubs and drinking alcohol was not well seen by their new religion. Others abandoned certain bad habits, such as "smoking hashish" or "screaming at parents", to name a few examples.

All are convinced that their decision, in no case, was forced. They made the decision freely and after a slow process of transformation, which began with doubts about some of Christianity's principles. Alex's friends insisted he was brainwashed, something he always denied. And Ana Maria assures that nobody has forced her or is forcing her to wear the hijab. "It was not imposed by my husband at all. I decided on my own and he asked me if I was sure. I did not have to be a Muslim to marry him, nobody forced me," she says.

## More than 20,000 converts

Both she (a 28-year-old girl born in Azuqueca de Henares), Alex (a 19 years old student from Parla), José Ángel (Madrid-born journalist, 35) and Consuelo (an assistant 55 that became Muslim in 1985) perfectly represent the broad spectrum of the more than 20,000 native Spaniards who embraced Islam in recent years. A considerable figure, if we take into account that Germany also has 20,000 and Italy with 5,000 is only surpassed by 70,000 from France and 100,000 from the U.K.

After the attacks of September 11 in the United States many people started associating Islam with terrorism. Many new Muslim converts started receiving strange looks from people around them, as if they were somehow responsible for those attacks just because they were Muslim. 

Consuelo regrets that when someone says that they are going to become Muslim, people believe that the next day they will show up "with a kalasnikov".

Álex's parents are very worried about him because they believe that people who become embrace Islam become terrorists. 

José Ángel defends himself that "before and now" has been able to separate "the extremism of a brainless of what is reasonably understood".
