José Ángel, Ana María, Consuelo and Álex are Spanish. Parents, grandparents and Spanish ancestors, who were baptized, read the Bible and made communion as good Catholics. They were four fervent believers of Jesus who went to mass and even studied in colleges of nuns ... until one day they began to doubt, so much so that they ended up taking the most important decision of their lives: to convert to Islam.

"Converting to Islam was the best decision I have made in my life," says José Ángel in a video, where his four friends agree that this decision changed them completely. Some made new friends, because going out at night to clubs and drinking alcohol was not well seen by their new religion. Others abandoned certain bad habits, such as "smoking hashish" or "screaming at parents", to name another example.

All are convinced that their decision, in no case, was forced. They made the decision freely and after a slow process of transformation, which began with the doubts that some principles of Christianity raised. Alex's friends insisted they had eaten his head, something he always denied. And Ana Maria assures that nobody has forced her or forced her to take off her veil. "It was not imposed by my husband (Moroccan) at all. I decided on my own and he asked me if I was sure. That to be with him I did not have to be a Muslim, that nobody forced me," he says.

## More than 20,000 converts

Both she (a 28-year-old girl born in Azuqueca de Henares), Alex (a student from Parla, 19 who became 2011), José Ángel (Madrid-born journalist, 35) and Consuelo (an assistant 55 that became Muslim in 1985) perfectly represent the broad spectrum of the more than 20,000 native Spaniards who embraced Islamism in recent years. A considerable figure, if we take into account that Germany also has 20,000 and Italy with 5,000, only surpassed by 70,000 from France and 100,000 from Great Britain.

None is very good associations that are usually made between terrorism and religion that decided to embrace, some of them, shortly after the attacks of 11-M. They perceive the strange look of those around them when they tell their conversion and feel that they always have to walk justifying themselves. Consuelo regrets that when someone says that they are going to become Muslim, people believe that the next day they will appear «with a kalasnikov»; Álex's parents "are very afraid, because they see that people who become atrocities", and José Ángel defends himself that "before and now" has been able to separate "the extremism of a brainless of what is reasonably understood".

Four lives, four stories different from these four Spanish Catholics who decided to abandon the religion of their parents, by the more than 1,700,000 Muslims (3.6% of society) currently living in Spain.
