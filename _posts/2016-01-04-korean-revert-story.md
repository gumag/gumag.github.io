Dear Brothers and Sisters in Islam.

My name is Abdurraouf Park and I am from Korea. Born into a Christian family in 1986, I was raised as a Christian and studied the Bible from a very young age. Since I was a child, I have always been a keen follower of God and His words. It was not until one day that I suddenly began questioning myself and my faith.

I became confused, and started to wonder... 'Who is the true God? Who is Jesus? Who am I worshipping?'. I have come to realise at that point that in the Bible itself, Jesus never claimed or said 'I am God' and he also never claimed or said 'I am the son of God'.

For a very long time, I've always prayed to find the truth, the true religion. I paid visits to many churches to seek and find the truth, but with my visits, I've come across many different groups of Christians, and I've almost given up on that idea. Until one day, I started reading books on religions and came across Islam, I then realised that Islam is God's true religion. I later began reading all books on Islam in the library. I really did not know anything on Islam before and that Islam believes in only One God, and that Jesus is God's messenger and Muhammad as the Last messenger of God. I did not know that Islam believed in this, because no one has ever mentioned or told me this before.

Alhamdulilah (Praise to God), on the 30th of December of 2009, I declared my Shahada and became a Muslim. Ever since I have become a Muslim, I've quickly engaged myself in Da'wah activities to increase awareness of Islam. I knew the need of spreading Islam. Korea is in a state of emergency, people do not know the truth and are losing hope in religion and oneself. This loss of hope and purpose of life and living is driving people to just die (suicide) even without war, diseases etc.

We must tell them the true message that 'There is only one God and Muhammad is the Last Messenger of God', tell them that 'Quran is God's book/words' 'Islam is the true religion of God', many people still do not know the bases of Islam and remain ignorant. Thus, away from the truth.

I have made an Islamic website in a Korean language to increase people's understanding of Islam and to invite Koreans to Islam, but also for everyone and anyone else. Alhamdulilah, there are now more people who are starting to know more about Islam. But, in order to do da'wah correctly, you need the 'correct' knowledge. That is why I decided to leave my country, Korea, in order to study Islam at the Islamic University of Madinah. 

I am currently 27 years of age, and studying Islam will take me a very long time to study, but I do not want to give up. I am just happy learning Quranic Arabic and understanding Allah's (God's) words. Alhamdulilah for the blessings of Islam and the Sunnah (Sayings and teaching of the last messenger of God). What really worries me, however, is that Koreans still do not know anything about Islam. So I ask you my dear brothers and sisters in Islam to please help me in spreading Islam in Korea.
