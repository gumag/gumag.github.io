**By Kainath, a Muslimah living in London**

Salaams, I want to share this story because we honestly take the little tings in life for granted!

So basically, we went to a small village in Gambia and this man was one of the elderly who told us about all their lives. He told us they have to travel miles for clean water, they have litle food and they have to walk 15 minutes just to use the toilet which is literally just a hole in the ground.

We asked him how he was, his reply 'Alhamdulilah' (All praise is due to Allah). Now this man, with literally just a roof on his head, barely any water or food yet he still praised Allah for everything he had, subhanAllah.

He was then asked how could we help his village.. his reponse was just mind blowing...He said 'A Masjid'. A man with nothing, little luxury to his life and village with nothing, he didn't ask for food or water...He asked for a masjid so his village could pray jummah together because they have to travel miles to their closest one which is difficult considering the heat and lack of water.

He said 'yes we do need a water well but Allah comes first'. This is the strength of a believer. To love Allah when you have nothing is Tawakkul, when you have that, you have everything. For the people who take their masjids for granted, people would do anything to pray in one. May Allah make us amongst his best of slaves.
