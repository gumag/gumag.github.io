Today I decided that I wanted to do my conversion story. I wanted to explain to 
people why I converted and also I was hoping that I could help some other people because
I know that when I was converting I didn't have anybody to look up to. I kind of felt
alone. I had Muslim friends who were already Muslim but I didn't have
somebody who had converted prior to me that I could really talk to.

I would go to YouTube but I found mostly men stories. I didn't find many stories of women so I'm here as
an American woman who was once Christian giving my story in hopes that it will help somebody
else. 

As I said before I was Christian and to be more specific I was Catholic and I want to
say that I did not have any problems being Catholic. I was happy as a Catholic. I was Catholic
for 21 years to be exact. 

I was born Catholic in a Catholic family and my whole family was either
Catholic or Christian and I even went to a Catholic school from kindergarten all the
way to 12th grade having a religion class every single day I know Catholicism really
well. Then I started to feel like I was doing these things because I had to, not because
I wanted to, so when I went to college I decided that I was going to go into
Catholicism for myself and learn things because I wanted to, not because I had to.

I started going to the church every Sunday and I joined the youth group on campus and I did
retreats. I was a retreat leader and I was very involved and I was really happy until
eventually I started feeling everybody getting into cliques and I didn't feel part of the
group anymore. I felt really left out. I started to search for other organizations, 
other religious organizations on campus. 

I joined the choir and all of those places I
felt really left out and also I felt like people weren't doing things for the right
reasons. I felt they were doing things to make themselves look good or feel good and it wasn't
for the mercy of God. Also I didn't feel well with those friends when we were at church
is okay but outside of church we don't talk about God it's not cool to talk about God
I love talking about God I love learning about religion and I just love religious talk
and it was uncool and I was ruining the vibe and I didn't I didn't like that feeling.

One day I met a group of Muslims we became really good friends and they taught me a lot
I was nervous and I asked them please can I ask you some questions I'm really sorry
if i insult you they said no no ask away please we want to help you. So I asked them questions.

Then eventually about a year later I started to date a guy from Saudi
Arabia and I remember when I was with him one day I had a crucifix and he says oh Jesus
I love him so much and that's just like wait what you what I was so ignorant at the time
I didn't know that Muslims love Jesus I thought that was really just interesting
and so he started to explain to me and go really in depth about Islam and I learned
so much from him then I started to wonder why do Muslims not eat pork so I started to
do the research and I saw it was in the Old Testament in the Bible and it was in Quran
and there was also a lot of health reasons why you shouldn't eat pork so I decided to
stop eating pork I haven't eat pork now for a year and a half and thankfully I actually
inspired my brother to stop eating pork Mashallah.

Then about half a year later I joined a
learning community and learning community was all about learning about other cultures
and so we went to an international festival at the local Masjid we went to Masjid
and if you don't know Masjid is it means Mosque we went to them to the Masjid and there
was all of these different cuisines from all over the Middle Eastern countries and it was
so cool and there was camels and a lot of just really cool stuff.

I was really excited
but the most memorable thing for me was the tour of the Mosque I remember my tour guide
talking about the mercy of Allah and it just drew me in and I was asking so many questions
and he was more than willing to answer. I asked him so many questions I feel like
he probably was so annoyed with me and then every time you talk about any Prophets that
were in Christianity they were also in Islam and I thought that was really interesting.

He talked about Adam peace be upon him Jesus peace be upon him Abraham peace be upon him
and I loved how every time he would say Prophets name he'd follow it with peace be upon him
immediately there was so much respect for these prophets and it was so refreshing then
he started to tell a story about the mercy of Allah and they made me I'll never forget
it he told the story about this man who was sinning all the time he did all of these terrible
things and on his deathbed he had his two sons come and he said when I die I want you
to take my body I want you to burn it and I want you to take my ashes and spread it
across the land so they did that they burned his body and spread it across the land he
thought that he'd be able to run away from God he did not want to seek the repentance of God.
Well that didn't affect his soul and God found him and asked him why did you do this why'd
you try to run from me you should have known that this wouldn't have worked and the man
said because I was in fear of you Allah I was so afraid I didn't know what else to do
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim he was so merciful he was so merciful upon this man and he said
that because you showed fear of me and I could tell you were very sorry for these things
that you've done I forgive you and he lets this man into Jannah he let him into heaven
this story was amazing to me.

I felt like if this man can get into heaven after doing all
these things then I can make it into heaven because I was constantly having my doubts
constantly afraid of everything I did in Christianity you're condemned for everything you do and
you need to go to confession and confess your sins and even if you go to confession you
still might have to go into purgatory you still aren't guaranteed a paradise this man
said God will never get tired of forgiving you as long as you never get tired of asking
for forgiveness hearing this gave me goosebumps and it made me so excited and so happy.

I remember
leaving that mosque that day and my friend saying you're gonna become Muslim aren't you
and I said no of course not I still think that Jesus is God so no I'm still gonna be
me I'm still gonna be Catholic I just really respect Islam a lot more now then I had I
started getting to friends I started to put my faith to the test start asking me questions
that I couldn't answer they started asking me questions about Jesus that I'd simply I
didn't know I never even thought of it that way so I started to question it from a different
standpoint.

I've been thinking about this my whole life and never really thought of it
that way so I started thinking about Jesus and the whole him being God in the Trinity
and I've been taught three and one Father Son Holy Spirit and then for those things
to just we just didn't make sense anymore and that really I started to question my faith.

I didn't know what I was who I was and what to believe anymore. I broke down I started
to cry everyday cuz I didn't know and part of me was drawn to Islam and I wanted to become
Muslim but I was too scared I would cry and I'd cry and I would talk to my friends and
I said I want to become Muslim I really do my heart and my heart but I'm scared what
are my friends gonna think what are my what is my family gonna think my family's gonna
disown me.

There was also some things about Islam that I didn't understand
and I needed answers so I met with many friends and I talked with them and even some of my
questions were too difficult for them and they said you need to talk with the Shaykh you
need to talk with the Shaykh or you need to talk with an Imam because I can't answer these
questions and I'm not gonna tell you something false about Islam so I even though I didn't
get same my answers I did get others and things started to make sense.

I felt welcomed I felt
loved and I felt at peace and I was so I starting to feel happy and I could finally openly discuss
my faith with people and they didn't think it was weird and I really loved that and then
again I started to feel scared because I was still thinking about my family and then I
said you know what I'm gonna pray I asked God to lead me in the right direction and
whatever direction he leads me to I will go and I will follow I will follow wherever God
leads me.

One day I felt the sudden urge to put my head on the ground when I put
my head on the ground I felt like I had the answer then one day I just my friends were
telling me that if I want to go to the Mosque and ask my questions to the Imam I need to
wear hijab and I had no clue how to wear a hijab and then one day when I was with that
learning community from before we went to Chicago and I bought a scarf that I was gonna
wear as a hijab and I wrapped it on my head and I wore it and as soon as I put it on I
felt confident and beautiful and I thought wow you can see my face you can see me and
I wore it for the rest of the trip.

I finally realized that Islam is where I belonged and
I got encouraged by friends my friends that were not Muslim and friends that were and
I also got discouraged by others that were both Muslim and not my friends were Muslim
were discouraging me simply because they didn't want me to become Muslim and then turn around
and become Catholic again they wanted to make sure I was ready they said if you're ready
then go for it but you got to be a hundred percent sure so then I decided for myself
I decided that I was going to become Muslim and then I called an Imam and it made it a
date and I talked with him asked him the questions that my friends could not answer he gave me
the answers I needed and I decided this is what I want I'm gonna be Muslim so I did itand scheduled my Shahada. 

Shahada is the right of the initiation just
that's all you need to do is to become Muslim is to say these simple words
Ash hadu alla ilaha illa Allah wa ash hadu anna Mohammadan abduhu wa Rasuluhu
these words mean I hereby
state that there is no god but Allah and I also state that Muhammad is His Messenger
once you say that you are Muslim.

My friends brought me they took me to the Mosque I said
my Shahada people always ask me what do you what did you feel like when you became Muslim
when it finally you said the Shahada and I said it Mashallah I can't explain it
when I when it happened I fell back I couldn't even I felt like I was gonna fall over it
was a whole new feeling when you convert all of the sins of your past are gone it's wiped
clean and you're brand new it's like your newborn baby it was freeing and I was feeling
I felt like crying it was liberating and freedom and just all of these different things that
I just simply cannot explain but it was the most amazing feeling in the world
