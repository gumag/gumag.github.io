A being exists that has all the positive qualities. This was proved by legendary mathematician Kurt Godel through a complicated formula. Two scientists have now verified that his proof of God is valid.

The last doubts are dispelled: God actually exists. A computer has proven it with cold logic - the MacBook of computer scientist Christoph Benzmuller of the Free University of Berlin.

Benzmuller set his computer down to a sequence of formulas that the legendary Austrian mathematician Kurt Godel first scribbled on a few loose sheets of paper around the year 1941 and then refined it further in the following decades. The computer did find Godel's proof valid. Benzmuller and his Viennese colleague Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo presented a first paper in which they announced their results on the preprint server arxiv.org . The existence of God can henceforth be regarded as a secure logical theorem.

Should mathematicians believe in God and theologians study formal logic? Even Godel himself was obviously not very fond of it. For decades he kept his proof of God secret. When he worked it out, he had fled from the Nazis from Vienna to the elite American university town of Princeton. There, the self-confessed Christian Godel walked regularly with Albert Einstein through the parks. Einstein also liked to speculate about God. It was not until 1970, when his health deteriorated so much that he suspected his death, that he broke his silence. He told his friend Oskar Morgenstern that although he was "satisfied" with his proof, he did not want to publish it for fear of being misunderstood. He showed proof to one of his students, Dana Scott. Scott wrote about it and made a presentation at Princeton. So Godel's proof of God still found its way out into the world.

## What is God anyway?

The proof is an extremely inaccessible formula structure. Godel formulated it in second-order modal logic - a language foreign to most mathematicians. In this exotic language of expression Godel sought to find sufficient conditions for the existence of God. But what is God, logically speaking? Godel defined him as a being that combines all the positive qualities. And what is a positive quality? Godel did not say much about that. He gave only two examples of positive qualities: to be God, and necessarily to exist. He also postulated that each property is either positive or its opposite. First, he proved that God may exist - and finally, that God necessarily exists.

However, Godel's argument was not completely complete. He did not explicitly write down all of his background assumptions and shortened many in a tedious section with daring mental leaps. Only for that reason did his proof fit easily on a notebook page. With their MacBook Benzmuller and Woltzenlogel have now filled those gaps. The computer carried out Godel's proof largely independently, only in two places, the scientists had to help him a little. "In perhaps three or four years, computers will be able to do it all by themselves," forecasts Benzmuller. The proof of God's proof is almost 300 lines long.

Kurt Godel is hardly known to the general public. But among scientists he enjoys a similarly high reputation as Albert Einstein. "The greatest logician since Aristotle" called him the philosopher Rebecca Goldstein. However, Godel was not born to be a star. Long before the word "nerd" he was the epitome of the nerd: slender, silent, almost finger-thick glasses, highly intelligent, quite lifeless.

His biography also indicates that he lived on the verge of paranoia. His last decades were spent in fear of being poisoned - so frightened that he finally ate only what his wife Adele, a former nightclub dancer, cooked for him and tasted. When a stroke put Adele out of action, she had to watch helplessly as her brilliant husband starved to death.

## Long search for the proof of God

The attempt to find compelling arguments for the existence of God is an age-old tradition. Aristotle gave proof of God more than 2300 years earlier and in later centuries he was followed by Anselm of Canterbury, Thomas Aquinas, Rene Descartes, Baruch de Spinoza and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. What is remarkable about all these clever arguments is how little convincing power they have. It is unlikely that any of them ever converted an atheist. Even if his existence was proved a thousand times: God remains a matter of faith.

Mathematicians know a similar phenomenon: to accept a conjecture as true, they are not satisfied with a purely formal derivation. They want to "see" with their imagination that the assumption is true. Therefore, controversial discussions arise again and again when computers help with evidence, such as the four-color theorem or Kepler's conjecture, because often these computer proofs are unmanageable for humans. In such cases, many mathematicians continue to search unimpressed for evidence that helps them "see."
