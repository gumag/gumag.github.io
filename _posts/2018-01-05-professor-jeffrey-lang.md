It is the Holy Quran, the word of our Lord Almighty, which God made a guidance and healing.

Professor Jeffrey Lang, a professor of mathematics at the University of Kansas, was born to a Christian Catholic family. He tells us the story of his Islam, where God took him from Catholicism to Islam, from idolatry and polytheism to Tawheed.

He spent the first eighteen years of his life between Roman Catholic schools, a journey that accumulated a great deal of questions about God and religion that Christianity was not able to answer for him. This led him directly to atheism and a conflict between his unsatisfied spiritual needs and the surrounding Christian environment. This increased his perplexity and loging to guidance.

After a long time of bitter struggle he was guided to Islam, which embraced his troubled soul and satisfied his spiritual needs with reasonable ideas that can be accepted by a man of mathematics and numbers and theories.

"Like many children of the 1960s and 1970s, I had a lot of questions about the religious, political and social values ​​of the time," he says. "I felt a rebelling against all those values ​​that the community sanctifies, including those of Catholic Christianity."

Dr. Jeffrey Lang later that these questions led him to a period of atheism, before being guided to Islam, which guided him to the facts he was looking for about God and the universe.

Islam in which he found a statement of the truth of the Lord - the Almighty - where he found the lifeline through some Muslim friends, when he was a lecturer at the University of San Francisco.

He threw questions on his colleagues, who marveled at the abundance of answers they had about all his questions.

The d. Jerry met with the Saudi student Mahmoud Kandil, who gave him a copy of the Koran and some Islamic books, and that this had a significant impact on his journey to Islam.

It reminds us d. Jeffrey said that as soon as he read the Koran he found himself rushing to the mosque of the university Muslim surrendering.

And confirms that he was finding answers to all the questions in question, but that what is going on in his mind in the evening is an answer in the morning, as if the Koran read his ideas and quick answer, he found himself and achieved what was looking for spiritual satisfaction.

And confirms d. Jeffrey, for his commitment to the teachings of Islam and perseverance on the five prayers, especially Fajr prayer, which is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best worship of Islam, which says in it: "Feel as if you moved from this world and contacted the world of angels;

When asked how to overcome the difficulty of reading the Qur'an in Arabic, which differs from his English, Jerry is an answer that comes from the depths of a heart wrapped in faith and permeated with the Qur'an: "Does a child feel comfortable if he hears his mother's voice ?!"

That is, although he does not understand his language, he is relieved to hear her voice.

He reads the Koran and saves the translation of its meanings, and the statement of its purposes, through the translated versions, but this did not lose the pleasure and enjoyment of the Koran in Arabic, which takes his heart and heart.

Thus the case of d. Jeffrey with the Koran , where he stressed that reading it provides a great deal of comfort and strength to face the difficult times.

In a statement of the superiority of Islam to other boredom confirms d. It is difficult for a mind that accepts only the mental truths to believe in other religions; it is to rely on faith in non-rational Muslims, but Islam is characterized by a discourse of reason.

He tells us about his current life after Islam, and notes that he is the advisor of the Muslim Student Association, through which he represents the channel of communication between Muslim students and the university administration.

In turn, d. Jeffrey has obtained approvals to hold lectures on Islam. He also helps Muslim students connect with American culture, as well as contributing to the completion of college entry procedures, as well as correcting misconceptions about Islam.

He married d. Jeffrey is a Saudi Muslim, and has compiled a number of books on Islam, which make good sales among the Muslim community in the United States.

Jeffrey, with the participation of readers to stand up to what was shown to him the magnificence of Islam during his journey and discover himself with Islam, and the book "SOS", which cuts his journey from atheism to Islam in detail.

When asked about the impact of Islam on his life, Jeffrey said that for the first time in his life he could live in a state of love with everything, in which Islam, the Koran and prayer had the greatest impact, derived from divine mercy.

With regard to the tribulations suffered by him because of his Islam, Jeffrey is the most severe of those exposed after the events of 11 - 9 when abandoned by the owners in the wake of a large case of negative towards Islam by the Americans, in addition to jeopardizing his career because he is a Muslim lecturer in one of the largest universities in the United States, The satisfaction of embracing Islam.

As for the service of Islam, he stressed d. Jeffrey said that a Muslim must offer Islam to others and show his good behavior in dealing with them and working with him. God Almighty has told His Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that guidance is in the hands of God Almighty and that He is only the author.

And concludes d. Jeffrey made a statement urging truth seekers to continue to search seriously, faithfully, objectively and courageously to discover the truth as he had discovered it.
