Salaam,

My name is Joseph and I am from Michigan. I converted in 2011 at the age of 16. When I tell people that, they think someone forced me to convert but Alhumdulilah it was my choice.

I always questioned catholism. Why do we worship Jesus so much but not God? In my history class we learned about the major religions of the world. Islam stuck my interest: Praying 5 times a day, fasting, giving to charity, hajj, and declaration of faith.

I did a year of research and comparing catholism to Islam. After that I finally made up my mind and took my shahada. I was so scared to tell my parents. They are strict Catholics. After 2 years of being muslim, I finally told my family.

My mom was extremely unhappy with me. She thought I did it to fit in. It was hard to explain to her why I did it because no matter she won't agree with me. Please just make dua that she at least accepts the idea I am a Muslim.

Thanks for reading my story.
